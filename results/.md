# Key Findings: GDP Forecasting Pipeline (ARIMA)

# Overview
This folder contains the consolidated results of the ARIMA-based GDP forecasting pipeline. Each entry includes:
- Country name
- Forecasted GDP per capita (USD) for the next 5 years
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metric

# Key Conclusions
-  Countries with longer, consistent GDP histories produced lower MAE values, indicating more reliable forecasts.
-  Economies with volatile GDP trends (frequent fluctuations or missing data) showed higher MAE, reflecting reduced forecast accuracy.
-  The pipeline successfully automated multi-country forecasting, enabling comparative analysis across diverse economies.
-  Forecasts highlight steady growth trends in developed economies, while emerging economies show greater variability.
-  The consolidated results table allows quick identification of top-performing models (lowest MAE) and countries with challenging forecasts.
